lm [count] [directory]
lmf [count] [directory]

Print absolute paths of <count> most recently modified files or directories in <directory>. If output is piped to another program, paths are separated by null instead of newlines.
When lm is invoked as lmf it doesn't consider directories.


Unless specified:

count = 1
dir = $PWD
