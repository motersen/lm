lm [count] [directory]
lmf [count] [directory]

Print absolute paths of <count> most recently modified files or directories in <directory>. If output is piped to another program, paths are separated by null instead of newlines.
When lm is invoked as lmf it doesn't consider directories.

Both arguments are optional and their order is irrelevant, as long as [count] is a natural number. Lacking arguments, lm searches the current directory for the single most recently modified file (or directory).
